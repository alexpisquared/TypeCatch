There was Gertrude.
And there was his sister Marian.
Norman and Arthur knew that speech.
He had heard them talking it.
And they were her brothers.
He left the alcove in despair.
From every side the books seemed to press upon him and crush him.
He had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big.
He was frightened.
How could his brain ever master it all?
And so he wandered on, alternating between depression and elation as he stared at the shelves packed with wisdom.
In a way, it spoke a kindred speech.
Both he and it were of the sea.
There it was; he would teach himself navigation.
He would quit drinking, work up, and become a captain.
Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment.
As a captain, he could marry her (if she would have him).
He cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books.
No; no more of the sea for him.
There was power in all that wealth of books, and if he would do great things, he must do them on the land.
Besides, captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them.
Noon came, and afternoon.
But when he found the right shelf, he sought vainly for the answer.
He abandoned his search.
The man nodded.
Are you a sailor?
""Yes, sir,"" he answered.
Now, how did he know that?
A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden.
He could not steel himself to call upon her.
He was afraid that he might call too soon, and so be guilty of an awful breach of that awful thing called etiquette.
The many books he read but served to whet his unrest.
Every page of every book was a peep-hole into the realm of knowledge.
His hunger fed upon what he read, and increased.
Also, he did not know where to begin, and continually suffered from lack of preparation.
The commonest references, that he could see plainly every reader was expected to know, he did not know.
And the same was true of the poetry he read which maddened him with delight.
He read more of Swinburne than was contained in the volume Ruth had lent him; and ""Dolores"" he understood thoroughly.
But surely Ruth did not understand it, he concluded.
These thoughts he had tried to share, but never had he found a woman capable of understanding - nor a man.
He had tried, at times, but had only puzzled his listeners.
And as his thoughts had been beyond them, so, he argued now, he must be beyond them.
He felt power move in him, and clenched his fists.
Those bold black eyes had nothing to offer.
He knew the thoughts behind them - of ice-cream and of something else.
They offered books and painting, beauty and repose, and all the fine elegance of higher existence.
Behind those black eyes he knew every thought process.
It was like clockwork.
He could watch every wheel go around.
Their bid was low pleasure, narrow as the grave, that palled, and the grave was at the end of it.
He had caught glimpses of the soul in them, and glimpses of his own soul, too.
""Lizzie,"" she replied, softening toward him, her hand pressing his arm, while her body leaned against his.
He talked on a few minutes before saying good night.
I kept it for you.
A week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth Morse, and still he dared not call.
Time and again he nerved himself up to call, but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died away.
But his eyes were strong, and they were backed by a body superbly strong.
Furthermore, his mind was fallow.
It had never been jaded by study, and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth that would not let go.
It seemed to him, by the end of the week, that he had lived centuries, so far behind were the old life and outlook.
But he was baffled by lack of preparation.
He attempted to read books that required years of preliminary specialization.
It was the same with the economists.
He was bewildered, and yet he wanted to know.
She had never had any experiences of the heart.
She did not know the actual fire of love.
She did not dream of the volcanic convulsions of love, its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched ashes.
She knew neither her own potencies, nor the potencies of the world; and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion.
It was only natural.
There was something cosmic in such things, and there was something cosmic in him.
He came to her breathing of large airs and great spaces.
She read Browning aloud to him, and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages.
In an immediate way it personified his life.
But her singing he did not question.
It was too wholly her, and he sat always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice.
She knew her Browning, but it had never sunk into her that it was an awkward thing to play with souls.
As her interest in Martin increased, the remodelling of his life became a passion with her.
Butler, Charles Butler he was called, found himself alone in the world.
His father had come from Australia, you know, and so he had no relatives in California.
She paused for breath, and to note how Martin was receiving it.
Butler; but there was a frown upon his face as well.
How could he live on it?
He must have lived like a dog.
His early denials are paid for a thousand fold.
Martin looked at her sharply.
Her eyes dropped before his searching gaze.
By nature he is sober and serious.
He always was that.
""You can bet he was,"" Martin proclaimed.
Her own limits were the limits of her horizon; but limited minds can recognize limitations only in others.
""But I have not finished my story,"" she said.
Butler was always eager to work.
He never was late, and he was usually at the office a few minutes before his regular time.
And yet he saved his time.
Every spare moment was devoted to study.
He quickly became a clerk, and he made himself invaluable.
Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise.
He became a lawyer, and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner.
He is a great man.
Such a life is an inspiration to all of us.
It shows us that a man with will may rise superior to his environment.
""He is a great man,"" Martin said sincerely.
And then, in splendour and glory, came the great idea.
He would write.
He would write - everything - poetry and prose, fiction and description, and plays like Shakespeare.
There was career and the way to win to Ruth.
Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to.
Once the idea had germinated, it mastered him, and the return voyage to San Francisco was like a dream.
He was drunken with unguessed power and felt that he could do anything.
In the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained perspective.
Clearly, and for the first lime, he saw Ruth and her world.
The thought was fire in him.
He would begin as soon as he got back.
The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasure-hunters.
He would sell it to some San Francisco newspaper.
He would not tell Ruth anything about it, and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print.
While he wrote, he could go on studying.
There were twenty-four hours in each day.
He was invincible.
He knew how to work, and the citadels would go down before him.
She did not think much of his plan.
Not that I know anything about it, of course.
I only bring common judgment to bear.
This education is indispensable for whatever career you select, and it must not be slipshod or sketchy.
You should go to high school.
""I would have to,"" he said grimly.
I must live and buy books and clothes, you know.
This change in him was her handiwork, and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him.
But the most radical change of all, and the one that pleased her most, was the change in his speech.
Not only did he speak more correctly, but he spoke more easily, and there were many new words in his vocabulary.
Also, there was an awkward hesitancy, at times, as he essayed the new words he had learned.
He was just beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder.
He told her of what he had been doing, and of his plan to write for a livelihood and of going on with his studies.
But he was disappointed at her lack of approval.
Up to then he had accepted existence, as he had lived it with all about him, as a good thing.
Who could tell?
He did not know enough to ask the man at the desk, and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove.
He had heard of book philosophy, but had not imagined there had been so much written about it.
The high, bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at the same time stimulated him.
Here was work for the vigour of his brain.
He could read English, but he saw there an alien speech.
How could she, living the refined life she did?
Higginbotham, who would have preferred the money taking the form of board.
On another night, his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a second-story window.
He saw only her head and shoulders, and her arms raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror.
Then she pulled down the shade.
She was of the class that dealt with banks.
In one way, he had undergone a moral revolution.
He had always been easy-going.
It was not in his nature to give rebuff.
In the old days he would have smiled back, and gone further and encouraged smiling.
But now it was different.
He did smile back, then looked away, and looked no more deliberately.
But several times, forgetting the existence of the two girls, his eyes caught their smiles.
It was nothing new to him.
But it was different now.
He had it in his heart to wish that they could possess, in some small measure, her goodness and glory.
And not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching.
He was not flattered by it; he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it.
He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act, intent on seeing her as she passed out.
Their casual edging across the sidewalk to the curb, as they drew near, apprised him of discovery.
They slowed down, and were in the thick of the crown as they came up with him.
One of them brushed against him and apparently for the first time noticed him.
She was a slender, dark girl, with black, defiant eyes.
But they smiled at him, and he smiled back.
Also, she was struck by his face.
It was almost violent, this health of his, and it seemed to rush out of him and at her in waves of force.
And he, in turn, knew again the swimming sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand in greeting.
The difference between them lay in that she was cool and self-possessed while his face flushed to the roots of the hair.
He stumbled with his old awkwardness after her, and his shoulders swung and lurched perilously.
Once they were seated in the living-room, he began to get on easily - more easily by far than he had expected.
She made it easy for him; and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever.
She had thought of this often since their first meeting.
She wanted to help him.
The old fascination of his neck was there, and there was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it.
As he gazed at her and listened, his thoughts grew daring.
I was never inside a house like this.
I wanted it.
I want it now.
Here it is.
I want to make my way to the kind of life you have in this house.
Mebbe I ought to ask him.
Ruth did not speak immediately.
She had never looked in eyes that expressed greater power.
And for that matter so complex and quick was her own mind that she did not have a just appreciation of simplicity.
And yet she had caught an impression of power in the very groping of this mind.
It had seemed to her like a giant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down.
Her face was all sympathy when she did speak.
You should go back and finish grammar school, and then go through to high school and university.
""But that takes money,"" he interrupted.
But then you have relatives, somebody who could assist you?
He shook his head.
The oldest died in India.
What it means is that a trust is like an egg, and it is not like an egg.
If you want to break an egg you have to do it from the outside.
The only way to break up a trust is from the inside.
Keep sitting on it until it hatches.
Somewhat to my surprise he acknowledged the corner.
""Once,"" said he.
But we lost out.
""Some unforeseen opposition came up, I suppose,"" I said.
We were self-curbed.
It was a case of auto-suppression.
There was a rift within the loot, as Albert Tennyson says.
That man was the most talented conniver at stratagems I ever saw.
Andy was educated, too, besides having a lot of useful information.
Oh, yes, the mine was all right.
The other half interest must have been worth two or three thousand.
I often wondered who owned that mine.
The town had about 2,000 inhabitants, mostly men.
I figured out that their principal means of existence was in living close to tall chaparral.
Me and Andy put up at a hotel that was built like something between a roof-garden and a sectional bookcase.
It began to rain the day we got there.
As the saying is, Juniper Aquarius was sure turning on the water plugs on Mount Amphibious.
But we could see the townspeople making a triangular procession from one to another all day and half the night.
Everybody seemed to know what to do with as much money as they had.
Bird City was built between the Rio Grande and a deep wide arroyo that used to be the old bed of the river.
Andy looks at it a long time.
And then he unfolds to me an instantaneous idea that has occurred to him.
Right there was organized a trust; and we walked back into town and put it on the market.
Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway.
The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light.
A vast silence reigned over the land.
The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness.
There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as
the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility.
It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life.
It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.
But there was life, abroad in the land and defiant.
Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs.
Their bristly fur was rimed with frost.
Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour
that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost.
Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind.
The sled was without runners.
It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow.
The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it.
On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box.
There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent,
occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.
In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man.
At the rear of the sled toiled a second man.
On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again.
It is not the way of the Wild to like movement.
Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement.
It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts;
and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man—man who is the most restless of life,
ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.
But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead.
Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather.
Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible.
This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost.
But under it all they were men, penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure,
pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space.
They travelled on without speech, saving their breath for the work of their bodies.
On every side was the silence, pressing upon them with a tangible presence.
It affected their minds as the many atmospheres of deep water affect the body of the diver.
It crushed them with the weight of unending vastness and unalterable decree.
It crushed them into the remotest recesses of their own minds, pressing out of them, like juices from the grape, all the false ardours
and exaltations and undue self-values of the human soul, until they perceived themselves finite and small, specks and motes,
moving with weak cunning and little wisdom amidst the play and inter-play of the great blind elements and forces.
An hour went by, and a second hour.
The pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade, when a faint far cry arose on the still air.
It soared upward with a swift rush, till it reached its topmost note, where it persisted, palpitant and tense, and then slowly died away.
It might have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness.
The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind.
And then, across the narrow oblong box, each nodded to the other.
A second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness.
Both men located the sound.
It was to the rear, somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed.
A third and answering cry arose, also to the rear and to the left of the second cry.
When a man journeys into a far country, he must be prepared to forget many of the things he has learned,
and to acquire such customs as are inherent with existence in the new land; he must abandon the old ideals and the old gods,
and oftentimes he must reverse the very codes by which his conduct has hitherto been shaped.
To those who have the protean faculty of adaptability, the novelty of such change may even be a source of pleasure;
but to those who happen to be hardened to the ruts in which they were created, the pressure of the altered environment is unbearable,
and they chafe in body and in spirit under the new restrictions which they do not understand.
This chafing is bound to act and react, producing divers evils and leading to various misfortunes.
It were better for the man who cannot fit himself to the new groove to return to his own country; if he delay too long, he will surely die.
The man who turns his back upon the comforts of an elder civilization, to face the savage youth,
the primordial simplicity of the North, may estimate success at an inverse ratio to the quantity and quality of his hopelessly fixed habits.
He will soon discover, if he be a fit candidate, that the material habits are the less important.
The exchange of such things as a dainty menu for rough fare, of the stiff leather shoe for the soft,
shapeless moccasin, of the feather bed for a couch in the snow, is after all a very easy matter.
But his pinch will come in learning properly to shape his mind's attitude toward all things, and especially toward his fellow man.
For the courtesies of ordinary life, he must substitute unselfishness, forbearance, and tolerance.
Thus, and thus only, can he gain that pearl of great price—true comradeship.
He must not say 'thank you'; he must mean it without opening his mouth, and prove it by responding in kind.
In short, he must substitute the deed for the word, the spirit for the letter.
When the world rang with the tale of Arctic gold, and the lure of the North gripped the heartstrings of men,
Carter Weatherbee threw up his snug clerkship, turned the half of his savings over to his wife, and with the remainder bought an outfit.
There was no romance in his nature—the bondage of commerce had crushed all that; he was simply tired of the ceaseless grind,
and wished to risk great hazards in view of corresponding returns.
Like many another fool, disdaining the old trails used by the Northland pioneers for a score of years,
he hurried to Edmonton in the spring of the year; and there, unluckily for his soul's welfare, he allied himself with a party of men.
There was nothing unusual about this party, except its plans.
Even its goal, like that of all the other parties, was the Klondike.
But the route it had mapped out to attain that goal took away the breath of the hardiest native,
born and bred to the vicissitudes of the Northwest.
Even Jacques Baptiste, born of a Chippewa woman and a renegade voyageur (having raised his first whimpers in a deerskin lodge north of the sixty-fifth parallel,
and had the same hushed by blissful sucks of raw tallow), was surprised.
Though he sold his services to them and agreed to travel even to the never-opening ice, he shook his head ominously whenever his advice was asked.
Percy Cuthfert's evil star must have been in the ascendant, for he, too, joined this company of argonauts.
He was an ordinary man, with a bank account as deep as his culture, which is saying a good deal.
He had no reason to embark on such a venture—no reason in the world save that he suffered from an abnormal development of sentimentality.
He mistook this for the true spirit of romance and adventure.
Many another man has done the like, and made as fatal a mistake.
The first break-up of spring found the party following the ice-run of Elk River.
It was an imposing fleet, for the outfit was large, and they were accompanied by a disreputable contingent of half-breed voyageurs with their women and children.
Day in and day out, they labored with the bateaux and canoes, fought mosquitoes and other kindred pests,
or sweated and swore at the portages.
Severe toil like this lays a man naked to the very roots of his soul, and ere Lake Athabasca was lost in the south,
each member of the party had hoisted his true colors.
The two shirks and chronic grumblers were Carter Weatherbee and Percy Cuthfert.
The whole party complained less of its aches and pains than did either of them.
Not once did they volunteer for the thousand and one petty duties of the camp.
A bucket of water to be brought, an extra armful of wood to be chopped, the dishes to be washed and wiped,
a search to be made through the outfit for some suddenly indispensable article—and these two effete scions of civilization discovered sprains or blisters requiring instant attention.
They were the first to turn in at night, with score of tasks yet undone; the last to turn out in the morning,
when the start should be in readiness before the breakfast was begun.
They were the first to fall to at mealtime, the last to have a hand in the cooking; the first to dive for a slim delicacy,
the last to discover they had added to their own another man's share.
If they toiled at the oars, they slyly cut the water at each stroke and allowed the boat's momentum to float up the blade.
They thought nobody noticed; but their comrades swore under their breaths and grew to hate them,
while Jacques Baptiste sneered openly and damned them from morning till night.
But Jacques Baptiste was no gentleman.
At the Great Slave, Hudson Bay dogs were purchased, and the fleet sank to the guards with its added burden of dried fish and pemican.
Then canoe and bateau answered to the swift current of the Mackenzie, and they plunged into the Great Barren Ground.
Every likely-looking 'feeder' was prospected, but the elusive 'pay-dirt' danced ever to the north.
At the Great Bear, overcome by the common dread of the Unknown Lands, their voyageurs began to desert,
and Fort of Good Hope saw the last and bravest bending to the towlines as they bucked the current down which they had so treacherously glided.
Jacques Baptiste alone remained.
Had he not sworn to travel even to the never-opening ice? The lying charts, compiled in main from hearsay, were now constantly consulted.
And they felt the need of hurry, for the sun had already passed its northern solstice and was leading the winter south again.
Skirting the shores of the bay, where the Mackenzie disembogues into the Arctic Ocean, they entered the mouth of the Little Peel River.
Then began the arduous up-stream toil, and the two Incapables fared worse than ever.
Towline and pole, paddle and tumpline, rapids and portages—such tortures served to give the one a deep disgust for great hazards,
and printed for the other a fiery text on the true romance of adventure.
One day they waxed mutinous, and being vilely cursed by Jacques Baptiste, turned, as worms sometimes will.
But the half-breed thrashed the twain, and sent them, bruised and bleeding, about their work.
It was the first time either had been manhandled.
Abandoning their river craft at the headwaters of the Little Peel,
they consumed the rest of the summer in the great portage over the Mackenzie watershed to the West Rat.
This little stream fed the Porcupine,
which in turn joined the Yukon where that mighty highway of the North countermarches on the Arctic Circle.
But they had lost in the race with winter, and one day they tied their rafts to the thick eddy-ice and hurried their goods ashore.
That night the river jammed and broke several times; the following morning it had fallen asleep for good.
'We can't be more'n four hundred miles from the Yukon,' concluded Sloper, multiplying his thumb nails by the scale of the map.
The council, in which the two Incapables had whined to excellent disadvantage, was drawing to a close.
'Hudson Bay Post, long time ago.
No use um now.' Jacques Baptiste's father had made the trip for the Fur Company in the old days,
incidentally marking the trail with a couple of frozen toes.
Sufferin' cracky!' cried another of the party.
'No whites?' 'Nary white,' Sloper sententiously affirmed; 'but it's only five hundred more up the Yukon to Dawson.
Call it a rough thousand from here.' Weatherbee and Cuthfert groaned in chorus.
'How long'll that take, Baptiste?' The half-breed figured for a moment.
'Workum like hell, no man play out, ten—twenty—forty—fifty days.
Um babies come' (designating the Incapables), 'no can tell.
Mebbe when hell freeze over; mebbe not then.'
The manufacture of snowshoes and moccasins ceased.
Somebody called the name of an absent member, who came out of an ancient cabin at the edge of the campfire and joined them.
The cabin was one of the many mysteries which lurk in the vast recesses of the North.
Built when and by whom, no man could tell.
Two graves in the open, piled high with stones, perhaps contained the secret of those early wanderers.
But whose hand had piled the stones? The moment had come.
Jacques Baptiste paused in the fitting of a harness and pinned the struggling dog in the snow.
The cook made mute protest for delay, threw a handful of bacon into a noisy pot of beans, then came to attention.
Sloper rose to his feet.
His body was a ludicrous contrast to the healthy physiques of the Incapables.
Yellow and weak, fleeing from a South American fever-hole, he had not broken his flight across the zones,
and was still able to toil with men.
His weight was probably ninety pounds, with the heavy hunting knife thrown in, and his grizzled hair told of a prime which had ceased to be.
The fresh young muscles of either Weatherbee or Cuthfert were equal to ten times the endeavor of his;
yet he could walk them into the earth in a day's journey.
And all this day he had whipped his stronger comrades into venturing a thousand miles of the stiffest hardship man can conceive.
He was the incarnation of the unrest of his race, and the old Teutonic stubbornness, 
dashed with the quick grasp and action of the Yankee, 
held the flesh in the bondage of the spirit.";
